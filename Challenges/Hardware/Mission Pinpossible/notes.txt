File appears to contain electric pulses using I2C - identified from the image using IC PCF8574T.

Upon googling that, it uses I2C which uses 2 channels (SDA, SCL). I downloaded Salae Logic 1 to decode it but it doesn't work.

The data decoded doesn't contain anything relating to the flag.

I've been looking at the IC itself, without looking at the LCD which is QAPASS UI.

Okay, I just cracked it.
Flag:
HTB{84d_d3519n_c4n_134d_70_134k5!d@}


Where do I start?
Step 1 - Look at the image, it's using an LCD + Arduino
Step 2 - Extract the data with Logic 1 (I2C) to txt or csv (op_pinpossible.txt)
Step 3 - I run this command to extract it all
cat op_pinpossible.txt| cut -d ',' -f 4 | sed 's/0b//g' | tr -d ' ' | grep -E ".*1.1*$"  | cut -c 1-4 | tr -d '\n' | perl -lpe '$_=pack"B*",$_' | sed 's/Enter Password//g' | tr -d '* '

How I got this is wild.
- Read the LCD 1602 datasheet. It explains how I2C works and the pins and how it all connects.
- Datasheet provides good information but isn't very necessary to crack the code.
- I had to read the LiquidCrystal code from https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C/tree/master
- In the LiquidCrystal_I2C.cpp/h file, there are a number of functions that show data is sent over the wire.
- What's important is this: To print to scren, it send the data (in 4 bit) with the En and Rs bit. These 2 bits indicate that it's been printed to screen.
- What I did was to grep for those as the final bits '.*1.1$' (regex) and then get the first 4 bits and voila! I see it all.

Thank you God. This was difficult
